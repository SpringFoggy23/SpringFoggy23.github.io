      <h2>Hackton in Blockchain With Smart Contract</h2>
      <p class="date">Nov 2025</p>

      <div class="blog-preview">
        As a beginner to the hackathon, I take part in the event with exploration. Surprisingly, I meet one of my course grader in the start of the event, and we formed the team. 
        Even we have some raw ideas about the project, we still missed the reward, just with a little distance. This is make me feel little sad and frustrated today. 
        Think about we have successfully deployed our smart contract, the frontend and js interacted with it, record the data on the chain. But we have no time to fully demo or record a video in the preparation. This causes that we did not fully deliver our idea to the judgement committee. <span style="color:red">Gave an Interesting Name to the project is nonnegotiable</span>
        For the last hour, don't only focus on the code development. Focus more time on the presentation organizatio,and preparing for the slides. I only immersed into the small happiness in finishing one debugging for one function, which is not important for the show time.  
        On this event I realized that in the unpolished presentations, even the English first language speakers will disorganize their expression or stuck. 
        We may know that for some groups, they even did not deploy the projects succcessfully. But they can get higher rank, with more time in explaining ideas, and some elaboration on the prototype.      
        It also reflects that majority of CS students from China are less active and not good at communicating with others. It always not be benificial to build trust and catch the process going with each other. At the end time of the development time, we started to realize the importance of exchanging the laptop.  
        What I experience today is that recording a video to demo is definetely a way that worthwhile to do that, it can change the speed and let presenters emphasize the particular point. Usually give the best expression to your auidence.
        I should always remind myself about the <span style="color: red;">DARPA</span><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about/heilmeier-catechism" target="_blank"> Heilmeier Catechism</a>
        
        <br>
        To deliver a clear, persuasive and high quality pitch: 
        <span style="color: red;">Keep this in mind, just like always remembering to turn around check there is no car driving approaching to you when you crossed the road. </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        What are you trying to do? Explain the objectives without any jargon.
        <br>
        <br>
        What is your workflow of each steps? Do you have any graph to show the process? How do you make this come true, or least give a road map.
        <br>
        <br>
        Who care your project? That is equal to the value of your project.
        <br>
        <br>

        For the rest of the tenet, these are mainly use in the designed period before the implementation, it can help you organize your idea, but not when you try to pitch to audience:

        How much will it cost?(Cost Expectation)
        How long will it take? (Time Expectation)
        What are the potential risk?
        Milestone. 

        A good pitch should motivate both the technical or nontechinal person know something about your idea.I wait for you to get progress and reply with the award you get in the next hackathon!!!
